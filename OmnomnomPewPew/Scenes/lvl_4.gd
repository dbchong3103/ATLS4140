#To make character move on two lines, just set up two chompers whose visibility toggles differently based upon the player's "teleportaion"
#Next Steps: Set up next two levels, set up ship being it's own player, then think about power ups, consider player ability to use their current skills as a means to unlocking future skills.
#Ship Idea: When the chomper makes a move or turn a projectile that attacks te ship appears --> I considered making this a power up, but the shpi can destroy said projectile.
